Overview
--------

This project demonstrates the integration of PySpark with Apache Cassandra and Hive to perform ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) and ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) operations. The goal is to build a scalable data pipeline that can handle large-scale datasets efficiently.

Project Description
-----------------

This project is the seventh in the PySpark series, where we focused on integrating PySpark with Apache Cassandra and Hive. The previous project (sixth) dealt with integrating PySpark with Amazon S3 and MySQL databases to perform ETL(Extract-Transform-Load) and ELT(Extract-Load-Transform) operations.

Tech Stack
------------

* **Language:** Python
* **Package:** PySpark
* **Services:**
	+ AWS EC2
	+ Docker
	+ Apache Cassandra
	+ Hive

Getting Started
----------------

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/1varma/DataPipeline-Hive_Cassandra.git`
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your AWS EC2 instance and Docker environment according to the project documentation.

Usage
-----

This project includes the following components:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Extract data from Apache Cassandra using PySpark.
*   **Data Transformation:** Transform the extracted data into a desired format using PySpark.
*   **Data Loading:** Load the transformed data into Hive for further analysis.

To run the project, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Start the Apache Cassandra container
docker-compose up -d cassandra

# Run the PySpark script to perform ETL and ELT operations
python etl.py
```

Code Structure
--------------

The code is organized into the following directories:

*   **src:** Contains the PySpark scripts for ETL and ELT operations.
*   **docker-compose.yml:** Defines the Docker containers for Apache Cassandra.
*   **requirements.txt:** Lists the required packages for running the project.
